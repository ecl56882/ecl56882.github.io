			<ul> 
			<li> In the first semester of my sophomore year, I took my very first accounting course. I registered for ACCT 2101 and set off on my first business course here at UGA. On the first day of class, my teacher announced that we would have 2 group projects throughout this semester. I had yet to be assigned a group project in College So I was not sure how this would all work. We were given a company and a list of transactions for that company during a period of time. We had to enter the transactions into a transaction analysis as the first picture shows below. We then had to take the transaction analysis and write up an accurate balance sheet and income statement for the company during that period as shown in pictures 2 (Balance Sheet) and 3 (Income Statement) I learned a lot from this project because it was my first experience working with a real-life accounting situation. These were real numbers and real transactions that my group had to appropriately enter into the books. It was a challenge but I feel that it definitely helped in prepared me for a real-world accounting situation </li>
