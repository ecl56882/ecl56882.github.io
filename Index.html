		<li> Accounting 2001 Group Project </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> In the first semester of my sophomore year, I took my very first accounting course. I registered for ACCT 2101 and set off on my first business course here at UGA. On the first day of class, my teacher announced that we would have 2 group projects throughout this semester. I had yet to be assigned a group project in College So I was not sure how this would all work. We were given a company and a list of transactions for that company during a period of time. We had to enter the transactions into a transaction analysis. We then had to take the transaction analysis and write up an accurate balance sheet and income statement for the company during that period. I learned a lot from this project because it was my first experience working with a real-life accounting situation. These were real numbers and real transactions that my group had to appropriately enter into the books. It was a challenge but I feel that it definitely helped in prepared me for a real-world accounting situation </li>

		<li> Computer Science Website Creation </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> The website you are looking at now is a website I created for an assignment in my Computer Science class that is called CSCI 1100. I had never taken a computer class before this so it took me a while to learn the ropes. I finally managed to understand the content learned and was able to apply it in making a website. It is the website you are on right now! I used the program Notepad++ and used HTML format to create this web page. I had to learn how to use different tags that signal when to do different things from inserting an image to inserting a hyperlink or just changing the font or background color.  It was a very time consuming process but I am very pleased with my results and look forward to expanding on this computer science knowledge in the future. </li>

		<li> Interpersonal Communications Project </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> Interpersonal Communications is a class that teaches students about the meaning of human behavior and human interactions. Before this class, I had no idea our brains, our decision-making process, and our behavioral process were so intricate. I was assigned a group project and my group of 6 had to research and create and present a presentation about the types of romantic love in relationships.  From manic love (obsessive lovers) to ludus love (game playing lovers) and all the in betweens, the project was very eye opening. Not only did I learn about the 6 types of romantic love, I also learned how to work with a group from long distance. This assignment was expected to be completed over a holiday break when my group of 6 would not be able to meet up to work. We had to divide and conquer and create a PowerPoint from different states. It was hard to communicate long distance but we ended up with a great presentation and it taught us all how to communicate over distance and still be successful in getting the job done. </li>
